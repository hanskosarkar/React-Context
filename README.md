# React-Context

## React Context API Example

This project is a simple demonstration of how to use the Context API and the useContext hook in a React application.

## Overview

The Context API is a way to share state between components without having to explicitly pass props at every level of the component tree. It's especially useful for providing data that can be considered "global" for a tree of React components.

In this project, we have created a simple application that displays how `cart` state is shared between different components using the Context API.

## Features

- Uses the Context API to manage and share user data.
- Demonstrates how to create a context and provide it to components.
- Utilizes the `useContext` hook to access context data within components.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hanskosarkar/React-Context.git
